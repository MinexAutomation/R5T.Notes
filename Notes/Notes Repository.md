# Notes Repository

I often find myself want to write notes about topics. The act of writing is a great aid to the act of thinking since it forces thoughts that might be nebulous an immaterial to become instead precise and concrete. Writing does this by allow you to "spitball" with yourself; your past and future self.

However, in addition to the benefit the mere act of writing provides, I also want notes to act as a storage medium that allows future thoughts to reference today thoughts. I want notes to act as artifacts, as tokens, as repositories of thought that can then serve as a foundation upon which tomorrow's thoughts can build. This means that notes should be kept in an easily accessible, easily remembered, easily searched location.

Finally, I find that many notes contain thoughts that, after many revisions, I want to share, or have the ability to share with the wider world.

In sum, I want to improve present thoughts, refer to past thoughts, and share future thoughts.

## Using GitHub

A GitHub repository is ideal for all these purposes.

GitHub allows:

- Using Markdown. Markdown allows the simplicity of writing notes in a text-file, with the ability to add formatting and structure if desired. GitHub has built-in support for Markdown; simply click the link for a Markdown file in the online interface and you will see your markdown.

- Version-control on the Markdown documents. Changes over time can be tracked and preserved.

- Work on notes from any machine!

- Notes to be shared everywhere online.

- Some notes to be private, while some notes are public, simply by being in either a public or private repository.
